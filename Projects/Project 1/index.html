                Last year, nVidia released their newest graphics card: the RTX serires. With this new card they boasted new technology like Ray Tracing and new architecture which was supposed to drastically increase performance.

                These new graphics cards promised to breakthough into new territory and accomplish calculations never thought of before on such a small scale. With these new cards development of anything graphics related just became easier.
